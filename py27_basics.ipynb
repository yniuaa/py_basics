    "### Chapter 1. Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 **print** statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a **print** statement, output a message of your choosing to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant difference between Python2 and Python3 is how you write a **print** statement. In Python 3, **print** has parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. print('Hello World')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings: a series of letters, numbers, or symbols connected in order.\n",
    "Strings are defined in double-quotes or single-quotes.\n",
    "We can combine multiple strings using **+**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When programming in general, we need to build systems for dealing with data that changes over time. The only important thing is that it may be different at different times. Python uses *variable* to define things that are subject to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and other numeric calculations are easy to do in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 Updating Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the contents of a variable is one of the essential operations. As the flow of a program progresses, data should be updated to reflect changes that have happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6 Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Used when you want to include a piece of information to explain a part of your code, you can use the **#** sign. A line of text preceded by a **#** is called a comment. The machine does not run this code - it is only for humans to read\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.7 Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can also hold numeric values. The simplest kind of number is the *integer* (a whole number with no decimal point). A number with a decimal point is called a *float*. You can also define a float using scientific notation with **e** indicating the power of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.8 Two Types of Division\n",
    "\n",
    "When we divide two integers, we get an integer as a result. If the numbers do not divide evenly, the result of the division is truncted into an integer. In other words, the quotient is rounded down to a whole number.\n",
    "\n",
    "To yield a float as the result instead, progammers often change either the numerator or the denominator (or both) to be a float\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.9 Multi-line Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want a string to span multiple lines, we can also use triple quotes. When a string like this is not assigned to a variable, it works as a multi-line comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.10 Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "The datatype which can only take one of true or false is called a boolean. In python, we define booleans using the keywords *True* and *False*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean is actually a special case of an integer. A value of *True* corresponds to an integer value of *1*, and will behave the same. A value of *False* corresponds to an integer value of *0*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.11 ValueError\n",
    "\n",
    "Python automatically assigns a variable the appropriate datatype based on the value it is given. A variable with the value *7* is an integer, *7.0* is a float, *'7'* is a string. Sometimes we will want to convert variables to different datatypes. For example, if we wanted to print out an integer a part of a string, we would want to convert that integer to a string first. We can do that using *str()*\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we have a string like *'7'* and we want to perform arithmetic operations on it, we must convert it to a numeric datatype. We can do this using *int()*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use *int()* on a floating point number, it will round the number down. To preserve the decimal, you can use *float()*."

    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Escaping characters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some characters that cause problems. We can use the backslash to fix the problem.\n",
    "For example, **'\\t'** is a tab, **'\\n'** is a newline, **'\\r'** is a carriage return, **'\\''** is the single quote character, **'\\\\\\'** is the literal backslash character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Access by Index\n",

    "String methods let you perform specific tasks for strings.\n",
    "for example **len()**, **lower()**, ** upper()**, **str()**.\n",
    "1. len() method returns the length of the string (the number of characters)\n",
    "2. lower() method gets rid of all the capitalization in the strings\n",
    "3. upper() method makes a string completely upper case\n",
    "4. str() method turns non-strings into strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Dot notations:\n",
    "We use **len(string)** and **str(object)**, but dot notation such as **'String'.upper()** for the rest.\n",
    "Methods that use dot notation only work with strings.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.7 String Formatting with %\n",
    "\n",
    "The **%** operator after the string is used to combine a string with variables. The **%** operator will replace the **%s** in the string with the string variable that comes after it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to print a variable that is an integer, you can \"pad\" it with zeros using **%02d**. The **0** means \"pad with zeros\", the **2** means to pad to 2 characters wide, and the **d** means the number is a signed integer\n",
    "\n",
    "You need the same number of **%s** terms in a string as the number of variables in parentheses.\n",

    "### Chapter 5. Lists and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1 Introduction to Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a *datatype* you can use to store a collection of different pieces of information as a sequence under a single variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 Access by index\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access an individual item on the list by its *index*. An index is like an address that identifies the item's place in the list. The index appears directly after the list name, in between brackets, like this: `list_name[index]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*List indices begin with 0, not 1!* You access the first item in a list like this `list_name[0]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.3 List Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you only want to access a portion of a list. We take a subsection of the list and store it in the **slice** list. We do this by defining the indices we want to include after the name of the list. In Python, when we specify a portion of a list in this manner, we ** include** the element with the first index, but we **exclude** the element with the second index.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your list slice includes the very first or last item in a list (or a string), the index for that item doesn't have to be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.4 Maintaining Order\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to search for an item in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we create a list with three strings.\n",
    "2. Then, we print the first index that contains the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also **insert** items into a list\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We insert a new item at specific index, which moves everything down by 1.\n",
    "2. We print out the new list\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5 For One and All\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to do something with every item in the list, you can use a **for** loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable name follows the **for** keyword; it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then **in list_name** designates **list_name** as the list the loop will work on. The line ends with a colon(**:**) and the idented code that follows it will be executed once per item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your list is a jumbled mess, you may need to **sort()** it.\n",
    "1. First, we create a list with three strings. The strings are not in alphabetical order.\n",
    "2. Then, we sort the list into alphabetical order. Note that **.sort()** modifies the list rather than returning a new list.\n",
    "3. Then, for each item in the list, we print the item out on their own line each.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.6 Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is similar to a list, but you access values by looking up a *key* instead of an index. A key can be any string or number. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### New Entries\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Lists, Dictionaries are *mutable*. This means they can be changed after they are created. One advantage of this is that we can add new *key/value pairs* to the dictionary after it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "An empty pair of curly braces **{}** is an empty dictionary, just like an empty pair of **[]** is an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length **len()** of a dictionary is the number of key-value pairs it has. Each pair counts only once, even if the value is a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Delete Entries\n",
    "\n",
    "Because dictionaries are mutable, they can be changed in many ways. Items can be removed from a dictionary with the **del** command. **del** will remove the key and its associated value from the dictionary. A new value can be associated with a key by assigning a value to the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.7 Remove from Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to remove something from a list. `my_list.remove(list_item)`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create a list with 5 strings.\n",
    "2. Then, we remove the first item from the list that matches the string. Note that **.remove()** does not return anything.\n",
    "3. Finally, we print out the list just to see that the item was actually removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.8 Iteration over Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**for** loops allow us to iterate through all of the elements in a list from the left-most (or zeroth element) to the right-most element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.9 Iteration over dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a **for** loop on a dictionary to loop through its *keys*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that dictionaries are *unordered*, meaning that any time you loop through a dictionary, you will go through *every* key, but you are not guaranteed to get them in any particular order.\n"

    "### Chapter 8: Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.1 While loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The **while** loop is similar to an **if** statement: it executes the code inside of it if some condition is true. The difference is that the **while** loop will continue to execute as long as the condition is true. In other words, instead of executing if something is true, it executes while that thing is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.2 Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "The *condition* is the expression that decides whether the loop is going to continue being executed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **loop_condition** variable is set to **True**.\n",
    "2. The **while** loop checks to see if **loop_condition** is **True**. It is, so the loop is entered.\n",
    "3. The **print** statement is executed.\n",
    "4. The variable **loop_condition** is set to False.\n",
    "5. The **while** loop again checks to see if **loop_condition** is **True**. It is not, so the loop is not executed a second time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.3 While loop example\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a **while** loop that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 squared (1,4,9,16,...,100), each on their own line\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.4 Break\n",
    "\n",
    "The **break** is a one-line statement that means \"exit the current loop\". An alternate way to make our counting loop exit and stop executing is with the **break** statement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a **while** with a condition that is always true.\n",
    "2. Using an **if** statement, you define the *stopping condition*. Inside the **if**, you write **break**, meaning \"exit the loop\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.5 While / else\n",
    "\n",
    "**while/else** is similar to **if/else**, but there is a difference: the **else** block will execute **anytime** the loop condition is evaluated to **False**. This means that it will execute if the loop is never entered or if the loop exits normally. If the loop exits as the result of a **break**, the **else** will not be executed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.6 enumerate function\n",
    "\n",
    "**enumerate** works by supplying a corresponding index to each element in the list that you pass it. Each time you go through the loop, **index** will be one greater, and **item** will be the next item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.7 zip function\n",
    "\n",
    "**zip** will create pairs of elements when passed two lists, and will stop at the end of the shorter list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.8 For/else\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with **while**, **for** loops may have an **else** associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the **else** statement is executed after the **for**, but only if the **for** ends normally - that is, not with a **break**."

    "\n",
    "#### 10.1 Iterators for Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the **.items()** method doesn't return key/value pairs in any specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **.items()** returns an array of *tuples* with each tuple cosisting of a key/value pair from the dictionary:\n",
    "- The **.key()** method returns a list of the dictionary's keys, and\n",
    "- The **.values()** method returns a list of the dictionary's values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, these methods will not return the keys or values from the dictionary in any specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a tuple as an immutable (that is, unchangable) list. Tuples are surrounded by **()**s and can contain any data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.2 The 'in' Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "For iterating over lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings, Python also includes a special keyword: **in**. You can use **in** very intuitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we create and iterate through a range, printing out **0 1 2 3 4**. Note that the trailing comma ensures that we keep printing on the same line.\n",
    "2. Next, we create a dictionary and iterate through. Dictionaries have no specific order.\n",
    "3. Finally, we iterate through the letters of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.3 List Comprehension Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a **new_list** populated by the numbers one to five\n",
    "2. Double the **new_list** generated above\n",
    "3. Only want the doubled numbers that are evenly divisible by three\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.4 List Slicing Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "List slicing allows us to access elements of a list in a concise manner. The syntax looks like this: `[start:end:stride]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where **start** describes where the slice starts (inclusive), **end** is where is ends (exclusive, and **stride** describes the space between items in the sliced list. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Omitting Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't pass a particular index to the list slice, Python will pick a default\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The default starting index is **0**\n",
    "2. The default ending index is the end of the list\n",
    "3. The default stride is **1**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reversing a list\n",
    "\n",
    "A *negative* stride progresses through the list from right to left\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stride lengh\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive stride length traverses the list from left to right, and a negative one traverses the list from right to left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, a stride length of 1 tranverses the list \"by ones\", a stride length of 2 traverses the lise \"by twos\", and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.5 Anonymous Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional programming** means that you're allowed to pass functions around just as if they were variables or values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Only we don't need to actually give the function a name; it does its work and returns a value without one. That's why the function the lambda creates is an *anonymous function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we pass the lambda to **filter**, **filter** uses the lambda to determine what to filter, and the second argument is the list it does the filtering on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas are useful when you need a quick function to do some work for you\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.6 Bitwise Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bitwise operations* are operations that directly manipulate *bits*. In all computers, numbers are represented with bits, a series of zeros and ones. In fact, pretty much everything in a computer is represented by bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Base 2 Number System\n",
    "\n",
    "When we count, we usually do it in base 10. That means that each place in a number can hold one of ten values, 0-9. In binary we count in base two, where each place can hold one of two values: 0 or 1. The counting pattern is the same as in base 10 except when you carry over to a new column, you have to carry over every time a place goes higher than one (as opposed to highr than 9 in base 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can write numbers in binary format by starting the number with **0b**. When doing so, the numbers can be operated on like any other number!\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bin() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In oder to print a number in its binary representaion, you can use the **bin()** function. **bin()** takes an integer as input and returns th binary representation of that integer in a string. (Note that after using the **bin** function, you can no longer operate on the value like a number)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also represent numbers in base 8 and base 16 using the **oct()** and **hex()** functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- int()'s Second Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "When given a string containing a number and the base that number is in, the funciton will return the value of that number converted to base ten\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left and right shift bitwise operators\n",
    "\n",
    "These oprators work by shifting the bits of a number over by a designated number of slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shift operations are similar to rounding down after dividing and multiplying by 2 (respectively) for every time you shift, but it's often easier just to think of it as shifting all the 1s and 0s left or right by the specified number of slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can only do bitwise operations on an **interger**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bitwise AND \n",
    "**&** operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that number are turned on if the corresponding bits of **both** numbers are 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using the **&** operator can only result in a number that is less than or equal to the smaller of the two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bitwise OR\n",
    "**|** operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that number are turned on if **either** of the corresponding bits of either number are 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the bitwise **|** operator can only create results that are greater than or equal to the larger of the two integer inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bitwise XOR\n",
    "\n",
    "**^** or *exclusive or* operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that number are turned on if **either** of the corresponding bits of the two numbers are 1, **but not both**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that if a bit is off in both numbers, it stays off in the result. Note that XOR-ing a number with itself will always result in 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bitwise NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitwise NOT operator (**~**) just flips all of the bits in a single number. This is equivalent to adding one to the number and then making it negative\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bit Mask\n",
    "\n",
    "A *bit mask* is just a variable that aids you with bitwise operators. A bit mask can help you turn specific bits on, turn others off, or just collect data from an integer about which bits are on or off."

    "### Chapter 11. Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.1 Why use Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called *objects*. You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its *methods*. For example, any time you call **len('string')** Python is checking to see whether the string object you passed it has a length, and if it does, it returns the value associated with that *attribute*. When you call **my_dict.items()**, Python checks to see if **my_dict** has an **items()** method (which all dictionaries have) and executes that method if it finds it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.2 Class Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic class consists only of the **class** keyword, the name of the class, and the class from which the new class **inherits** in parentheses. For now, our classes will inherit from the **object** class. This gives them the powers and abilities of a Python object. By convention, user-defined Python class names start with a capital letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "__init__(): This function is required for classes, and it's used to **initialize** the objects it creates. **__init__()** always takes at least one argument, **self**, that refers to the object being created. **self** is the *first* parametr passed to **__init__()**. Python will use the first parameter that **__init__()** receives to refer to the object being created; this is why it's often called **self**, since this parameter gives the object being created its identity. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.3 Instantiating the Object\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the attributes of our objects using *dot notation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.4 Class Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of a variable is the context in which it's visible to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with classes, you can have variables that are available everywhere (*global variable*), variables that are only available to members of a certain class (*member variable*), and variables that are only available to particular instances of a class (*instance variables*).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.5 A Methodical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class has its own functions, those functions are called *methods*. You've already seen one such method: **__init__()**. But you can also define your own methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.6 Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another, and it's used to express an *is-a* relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.7 Override\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you'll want one class that inherits from another to not only take on the methods and attributes of its parent, but to *override* one or more of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can directly access the attributes or methods of a superclass with Python's built-in **super** call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11.8 Representaion\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful class method to override is the built-in **__repre__()** method, which is short for *representation*; by providing a return value in this method, we can tell Python how to represent an object of our class(for instance, when using a **print** statement)"
